# Essential Materials Databases

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

For building an AI/ML model, there is a need of the huge input database, the data may be the experimental results such as dielectric constants of the perovskites or a collection of the work functions of the perovskite halides, another way is the open-source materials database. Here, we are providing a direct way to reach to the various materials databases for implementing the AI/ML models particularly for the materials science. 

1.	The Materials Project (https://materialsproject.org/): A database of over 100,000 materials and their properties, including crystal structures, electronic properties, and thermodynamic data.
2.	The NIST Materials Data Curation System (https://mml.nist.gov/MDS/): A database containing a wide range of materials data including phase diagrams, crystal structures, and thermal properties.
3.	The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) (https://oqmd.org/): A database of over half a million theoretical and experimental materials properties, including formation energies, crystal structures, and electronic properties.
4.	The Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) (https://icsd.fiz-karlsruhe.de/search/index.xhtml): A database containing over 400,000 crystal structures of inorganic compounds and minerals.
5.	The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd/): A database of over 900,000 small-molecule crystal structures, including organic, inorganic, and organometallic compounds.
6.	The Polymer Data Service (https://www.polymerdatabase.com/): A database of polymer properties, including mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties.
7.	The Ceramic Data Compilation (CDC) (https://ceramics.org/ceramic-data-compilation-cdc): A database containing physical and chemical properties of ceramics and glass materials, including thermal expansion and electrical properties.
8.	The Alloy Phase Diagram Database (APD) (https://www.aps.anl.gov/Alloy-Phase-Diagram/Home.aspx): A database of binary and ternary alloy phase diagrams, including equilibrium phase diagrams and solidification paths.
9.	The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) (https://www.mgi.gov/): A database that provides access to materials data, tools, and resources to support materials innovation and design.
10.	The Nano Material Database (NMD) (http://www.nano.gov/nanomaterial-database): A database of over 2,000 nanomaterials, including their properties, synthesis methods, and potential applications.
